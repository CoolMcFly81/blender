/* General Non-Local Means filter implementation.
 * NLM essentially is an extension of the bilaterail filter: It also loops over all the pixels in a neighborhood, calculates a weight for each one and combines them.
 * The difference is the weighting function: While the Bilateral filter just looks that the two pixels (center=p and pixel in neighborhood=q) and calculates the weight from
 * their distance and color difference, NLM considers small patches around both pixels and compares those. That way, it is able to identify similar image regions and compute
 * better weights.
 * One important consideration is that the image used for comparing patches doesn't have to be the one that's being filtered.
 * This is used in two different ways in the denoiser: First, by splitting the samples in half, we get two unbiased estimates of the image.
 * Then, we can use one of the halves to calculate the weights for filtering the other one. This way, the weights are decorrelated from the image and the result is smoother.
 * The second use is for variance: Sample variance (generated in the kernel) tends to be quite smooth, but is biased.
 * On the other hand, buffer variance, calculated from the difference of the two half images, is unbiased, but noisy.
 * Therefore, by filtering the buffer variance based on weights from the sample variance, we get the same smooth structure, but the unbiased result.

 * Parameters:
 * - x, y: The position that is to be filtered (=p in the algorithm)
 * - noisyImage: The image that is being filtered
 * - weightImage: The image used for comparing patches and calculating weights
 * - variance: The variance of the weight image (!), used to account for noisy input
 * - filteredImage: Output image, only pixel (x, y) will be written
 * - rect: The coordinates of the corners of the four images in image space.
 * - r: The half radius of the area over which q is looped
 * - f: The size of the patches that are used for comparing pixels
 * - a: Can be tweaked to account for noisy variance, generally a=1
 * - k_2: Squared k parameter of the NLM filter, general strength control (higher k => smoother image)
